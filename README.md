This project was bootstrapped with [Spring Initializr](https://start.spring.io/). It uses ReactJS as frontend. 

The purpose of this project is to provide a ready to use web application with minimal effort. The data is hardcoded at the moment but i'll be connecting it to a NoSQL db as I start learning it.

More features will be supported as I continue experimenting with React, Spring, and MUI. 

You can find the frontend of this project here: [spreact-frontend] (https://github.com/saranshbansal/spreact-frontend)
